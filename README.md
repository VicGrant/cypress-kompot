This is a practice test project for QA Automation using Cypress framework thru POM programming pattern.
The project is in very early stages and  also includes personal experiments with 'getter' functions for storing element selectors and test methods.
Currently only the navbar links, settigns page links and end-to-end'happy path' tests have been written for the new-order page.
